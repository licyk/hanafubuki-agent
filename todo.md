# Follow-ups

## Plan: visible thinking and the documentation site (2026-11-09)

The plan is [docs/plan-thinking-and-site.md](docs/plan-thinking-and-site.md);
every recommendation in its §5 was accepted (store thinking in history; drop
Hanafubuki's separate thinking timer; a bilingual site, zh-CN by default;
`extraction-plan.md` not carried over; GitHub Pages; one new history-corpus
fixture recorded deliberately; Giscus follows the site's theme and locale).
The next release with it is 0.2.0 (the headline event is removed).

- [x] T1: thinking in the model API (three protocols, `reasoning.summary`)
      and the kernel (three events, `ConversationItem::Reasoning`, its own
      budget), the headline removed (spec.md §5 "Thinking" and §8
      model-api, [docs/cli.md](docs/cli.md) event table). Each item is cut
      at `AgentHardLimits::maximum_reasoning_text_bytes` (256 KiB) and no
      longer spends `maximum_model_output_bytes`; a response that stops
      early completes its open items. No request golden sets an effort, so
      none changed; the new corpus is `golden/history-reasoning/` with
      `recorded_reasoning_history_transcript.json`, and `golden/history/` is
      unchanged.
  - What T2 and T3 build on (serialized as the facade serializes them):
    - `AgentEventKind::ReasoningStarted { reasoning_id, sampling_step }` →
      `{"type":"reasoning_started","reasoningId":3,"samplingStep":1}`;
      `ReasoningDelta { reasoning_id, delta }` →
      `{"type":"reasoning_delta","reasoningId":3,"delta":"…"}` (Markdown,
      concatenated as is: a new summary part's delta starts with its blank
      line); `ReasoningCompleted { reasoning_id, duration_millis }` →
      `{"type":"reasoning_completed","reasoningId":3,"durationMillis":1200}`.
      Started → deltas → completed, all before the step's
      `history_committed`; an item may have no delta (a provider that sent
      no text). `AgentReasoningId` (a `u64`, unique in the session, drawn
      from the message counter) is re-exported by the facade. A turn that
      fails mid-stream sends no completion: end live blocks at the turn's
      terminal event.
    - `ConversationItem::Reasoning { text, duration_millis, sampling_step,
      truncated }` →
      `{"type":"reasoning","text":"…","durationMillis":1200,"samplingStep":1,"truncated":false}`,
      committed with the step's other items in the model's order (normally
      ahead of the step's tool calls and answer). It carries no reasoning id: a live
      block is replaced by the items of the `history_committed` that follows
      its completion. Exhaustive matches on `ConversationItem` need an arm.
    - Removed: `AgentEventKind::ReasoningHeadlineUpdated`
      (`reasoning_headline_updated`) and `AgentTurnSnapshot::reasoning_headline`
      (`reasoningHeadline`). `ReasoningUpdated` and `AgentReasoningSnapshot`
      (the turn's thinking time) are unchanged.
    - Model API: `ModelEvent::ReasoningSummaryDelta` is now
      `ReasoningDelta { item_id, kind: ModelReasoningTextKind, index, delta }`
      and `ModelOutputItem::Reasoning` has `content: Vec<String>` beside
      `summary`; a Responses request with an effort sends
      `"reasoning":{"effort":…,"summary":"auto"}`, which changes a host's
      request goldens only where they set an effort.
    - `AgentHardLimits` has `maximum_reasoning_text_bytes`: a struct
      literal without `..FIRST_BATCH_HARD_LIMITS` needs it.
      `history_committed`'s `itemCount` counts the step's reasoning items.
    - Test support: `reasoning_tool_events` and `reasoning_answer_events`
      (Responses streams whose reasoning summary streams).
  - Open: reasoning items count toward the history bounds
    (`maximum_history_bytes`, 4 MiB, and `maximum_history_items`, 1024, one
    more item per thinking step) but not toward the token estimate that
    triggers compaction. Compaction drops them, so a session that compacts is
    unaffected; a long session that thinks a lot and uses little context
    can now reach `LimitExceeded { "history bytes" }` sooner. Decide whether
    compaction also triggers on the history bounds, or whether a reasoning
    item's bytes leave `retained_bytes`.
- [x] T2: the TUI thinking cell (`history_cell/thinking.rs`), Ctrl-O,
      Working without the headline; `exec`'s `· thought for 12s` on
      standard error and `sessions show`'s `thought for 12s` line
      ([docs/cli.md](docs/cli.md) "Thinking", architecture.md §3.7).
  - What T3 mirrors: collapsed by default; live `Thinking 5s` counting up
    from the cell's own start, completed `Thought for 12s` from the
    kernel's `durationMillis` (seconds, rounded down; `(truncated)` when
    the item says so); an empty text shows the header only; the turn's
    terminal event completes a live block with the time so far; one
    toggle for the live block and every later one; a reasoning update
    that arrives while a message streams is held until that message
    completes, so the transcript keeps the model's order. The live text
    is the streamed text; for an item that streamed both a summary and
    raw text the committed item (the summary) is what a reload shows.
  - Open (found in T2, not changed): `sessions show` prints its items
    latest first, in the page's order, where a person reads a transcript
    oldest first.
- [ ] T3 (Hanafubuki): the thinking block, Working without the headline or
      the thinking timer, the Task Center showing the configuration's
      recoveries.
  - Copy `crates/agent/src/tests/golden/history-reasoning/` (one session,
    `active/2026/11/09/session-2026-11-09T04-11-30-1.jsonl`) and
    `recorded_reasoning_history_transcript.json` byte for byte into the
    integration's `src/tests/golden/`, with the twin of
    `recorded_reasoning_history_reopens_and_continues` (`golden.rs`): it
    opens with both reasoning items' text and the next request carries
    none of it. The recorded prompt is "List the Skills." and its tool
    `skills_list`.
- [x] D1: the `site/` framework, tooling, Giscus, Umami, `site.yml`.
      Hanafubuki's site at its versions, without its home and download
      pages; a small home page; Giscus starts from the given attributes
      and follows the site's theme and language once its frame has loaded
      (its first message); `cargo xtask version` also scans
      `site/content/docs/**/*.mdx`. Under the Pages base, TanStack Start's
      static server functions fetched from the origin root, which broke
      client-side navigation: `patches/` prefixes Vite's base
      (AGENTS.md, "Site"). The router links with a trailing slash, so
      giscus's `pathname` term is the same for a page reached by URL or by
      in-site navigation.
- [ ] D2: the content rewrite, bilingual; `docs/` removed; links re-pointed.
  - `index`, `installation` and `quick-start` (both languages) are drafts
    to replace; the sidebar's sections go in `meta.json` and
    `meta.en.json`, in the same order.
  - Once `docs/` is gone, `snippet_files` in `xtask/src/version.rs` drops
    its `docs/*.md` scan, with its test; the README's documentation list
    and AGENTS.md's document table point at the site.
- [ ] D2b (Hanafubuki): its links into this repository's docs re-pointed.
- [ ] D3: GitHub Pages.
  - Enable Pages (source: GitHub Actions) in the repository settings, and
    add a deploy job to `site.yml` on push to main that publishes the
    built `site/.output/public` (the `site` artifact today; `404.html` is
    the SPA shell, `.nojekyll` is in it).
  - Giscus maps `pathname`, which keeps a trailing slash: Pages serves a
    page at `/hanafubuki-agent/docs/x/`, so the router links with the
    slash too (`trailingSlash: "always"`, checked locally against a
    server that redirects as Pages does). Confirm on the live site that
    a page reached by URL and by in-site navigation opens one thread.

## Extraction from Hanafubuki

The phases are in [docs/extraction-plan.md](docs/extraction-plan.md) §14;
Hanafubuki's `todo.md` tracks them with their done notes. Phases 1–3 are
done: the workspace, the decoupling inside Hanafubuki's tree, and the move.

- [x] Phase 4a: what the facade needs to run without a host: config
      layering (`AgentConfig::layered`, `ConfigLayers`, `-c` from Codex,
      `[network]`, `logLevel`, `AgentDirs`/`HANAFUBUKI_AGENT_HOME`), the
      data-dir lock (both modes), the standalone log file, the keyring
      store, the cwd workspace and `AgentRuntime::standalone`
      ([docs/config.md](docs/config.md), architecture.md §3.6, §10).
- [x] Phase 4b: the CLI (`hanafubuki-agent-cli`, binary `hanafubuki-agent`,
      `clap`): the global flags, `exec` (text and JSON lines, `--approve`,
      questions on a terminal, exit codes, `-o`), `config path|get|set|edit`
      (`AgentConfig::value`, `set_user_value`, `layer_sources`), `providers`,
      `mcp`, `sessions`, `skills`, `memory`, `doctor`; the proxy in the
      Agent's processes' environment; the host-supplied identity
      (`AgentHostInstructions::identity`, `application`)
      ([docs/cli.md](docs/cli.md), architecture.md §3.6). Phase 4 is done:
      an `exec` turn against the scripted model runs end to end in CI
      (`crates/cli/tests/exec.rs`).
  - Deferred: `mcp add` sets no credentials (`credentialEnvironment`,
    `credentialHeaders`, OAuth login are edited in `mcp.toml`); `providers
    add` takes no request headers; `exec` resumes no session and attaches
    no images; `doctor` cannot say which process holds the data directory
    (the lock file names none); a management command that starts the Agent
    also starts its MCP servers in the background, as every start does;
    Ctrl-C during a command other than `exec` ends it without a shutdown
    (the lock goes with the process, the next start reaps its processes).
  - AGENTS.md discovery reads the working directory's and the Git root's
    own `AGENTS.md` (each a root), not the directories between them, since
    the runtime selects no target; Codex reads every level.
- [ ] Hanafubuki, when it moves its pin past Phase 4a: nothing to change for
      the lock (it is taken by the start marker); `AgentProxy` is now
      `hanafubuki_agent_config::AgentProxy`, re-exported where it was.
- [ ] Hanafubuki, when it moves its pin past Phase 4b:
  - `AgentHostInstructions` has two new fields (its struct literal in
    `hanafubuki-agent-integration/src/host.rs`, `application_instructions`,
    stops compiling): pass `identity: "You are the desktop application's
    coding and operations agent.".to_string()` and `application:
    "Hanafubuki".to_string()`, the strings the Agent used to have, and the
    integration goldens stay byte-identical (checked here by building the
    facade's goldens with those values); the history corpus is unchanged.
  - `docs/agent-integration.md`: the host instructions now carry the
    identity and the application name.
  - Nothing else: the facade's other changes are additions (re-exports of
    MCP, approval and user-input types, `probe_keyring`, the
    configuration's key API), and the CLI is a crate Hanafubuki does not
    depend on.
- [x] Phase 5a: the terminal interface's core (`hanafubuki-agent-tui`,
      architecture.md §3.7, [docs/cli.md](docs/cli.md)): upstream ratatui
      0.30 and crossterm 0.29 (Codex's git forks dropped, the palette
      query too), the inline viewport and scrollback, the app loop, the
      chat widget and its history cells, markdown and streaming, the diff
      of a `PatchPreview`, the composer, the status line and key hints, the
      approval and question overlays, `agent_bridge.rs`; bare
      `hanafubuki-agent [PROMPT]` runs it on a terminal. NOTICE carries
      Codex's NOTICE and license and Ratatui's.
- [x] Phase 5b: the rest of the terminal interface (architecture.md
      §3.7, [docs/cli.md](docs/cli.md#commands)): the slash commands with
      the composer's popup (`/model` from the Providers' model catalogs
      and `set_session_model`, `/mode`, `/skills`, `/new`, `/resume`,
      `/compact`, `/diff`, `/mention`, `/status`, `/mcp`, `/quit`,
      `/exit`), the transcript pager (Ctrl-T) and `/diff`'s on the
      alternate screen, the resume picker over the history store's session
      pages with the transcript replayed, `hanafubuki-agent resume
      [ID|--last] [PROMPT]`, `@` file mentions from Codex's `file-search`
      (in the TUI crate, on `nucleo` 0.5), and `cargo xtask check-notices`
      (`architecture/notices-policy.toml`). The facade gained
      `workspace_roots()` and re-exports `AgentCompactionStatus`. Phase 5
      is done: a pty run covers the popup,
      `/status`, a mention, a turn, Ctrl-T, `/diff`, `/model`, `resume`
      and `resume --last` against a fake Responses server.
  - Deferred from 5b: the permission mode changed from the interface (it
    is the configuration's; a per-session one is not in the facade);
    plan mode's "implement this plan?" prompt (switch back with `/mode`
    and ask); `/model`'s reasoning effort; the transcript pager's live
    tail of the running call and Codex's backtracking (Esc to edit an
    earlier message); a replayed tool call shows its name without the
    subject the live event carried (the history keeps the arguments,
    not the presentation); `/skills` lists the catalog, it does not
    toggle or insert a Skill; the sessions in the resume picker show no
    working directory or branch (the summaries have none); `exec`
    resumes no session; syntax highlighting (no `.tmTheme` is shipped).
  - Every start of the interface (and `resume` on the picker) creates a
    session that stays in the history, a turn run in it or not: the
    picker hides the sessions no turn ran in, `sessions list` does not.
    Create the session with the first message, or delete an unused one
    on quit.
  - Still deferred from 5a: images in the composer (paste, attach); a
    session's earlier messages in the composer's history (only this
    run's); desktop notifications; Ctrl-Z suspend; the external editor;
    the reasoning summary cells (the Agent's events carry no reasoning
    text); the time-worked separator counts from the status line's
    timer; a contained Agent panic writes its report to standard error,
    over the interface, as the Agent's hook does everywhere.
- [ ] Hanafubuki, when it moves its pin past Phase 5a: nothing to change.
      The facade gained re-exports only (`AgentTaskPlanSnapshot`,
      `AgentTaskPlanStep`, `AgentTaskPlanStepStatus`, `AgentToolPresentation`,
      `AgentUserInputOption`, `AgentUserInputQuestion`, `ApprovalAction`,
      `ApprovalActionKind`, `ToolOutput`, `ToolOutputContent`), and the TUI is
      a crate Hanafubuki does not depend on.
- [ ] Hanafubuki, when it moves its pin past Phase 5b: nothing to change.
      The facade gained one call, `AgentApplicationService::workspace_roots`
      (an addition over the host's `WorkspaceRootsPort`), and re-exports
      `AgentCompactionStatus`; the TUI and the
      CLI are crates Hanafubuki does not depend on, and nothing the model
      sees changed (the goldens and the history corpus are untouched).
- [x] Phase 6, the repository's part: clippy with `-D warnings` in CI
      (an `#[allow]` names its reason); `release.yml` (`plan`,
      `ci-result`, `checks`, `publish`, `licenses`, `binaries` for four
      targets, `github-release`), resumable by a manual run on the tag;
      the archives carry LICENSE, NOTICE and `THIRD-PARTY-LICENSES.txt`
      from `cargo-about` 0.9.2 (`about.toml`, `about.hbs`), which covers
      `nucleo`'s and the other MPL-2.0 crates; every crate but `xtask`
      packages and verifies (`cargo publish --workspace --dry-run`); the
      checklist is [docs/release.md](docs/release.md).
- [ ] Phase 6, the user's step: `cargo xtask tag --push` on `main` for
      `v0.1.0` and watching the release run (about three and a half hours
      under crates.io's new-crate limit; resume with `gh workflow run
      release.yml --ref v0.1.0`). Done when the crates are on crates.io
      and the archives on the GitHub release.
- [ ] Hanafubuki, when it moves its pin past Phase 6: nothing to change.
      The clippy fixes boxed variants of internal enums only (the public
      `AgentModelContextBoundary` keeps its shape under an allow), and
      removed `ProcessOwnershipRegistry::len` and `ReservationSet::len`
      from `hanafubuki-agent-process`'s test support, which nothing
      called (its twin, `hanafubuki-process`, may keep them).
- [x] The configuration's recovery (Hanafubuki's open item from 2b): a
      repair whose original cannot be kept in `.recovery/` (or whose
      repaired file cannot be written) leaves the values in memory and the
      file read-only until restart, instead of failing the read; each
      repair is an `AgentConfigRecovery` (`AgentConfig::recoveries`), which
      `doctor` prints; a new file lists its keys in declared order. A hand
      edit is read at the next write or restart, by design (as Hanafubuki's
      Config and Codex).
- [ ] Hanafubuki, at its first pin past this (T3 does it): the recoveries in
      the Task Center's configuration recovery notice (the integration maps
      `AgentConfigRecovery` onto a `ConfigRecoveryReport` for the Agent's
      files); nothing else changes.

## Shared with the other repository

Twins: a fix to one is ported to the other by hand. Hanafubuki's `todo.md`
keeps the same list.

- `hanafubuki-agent-foundation` ↔ Hanafubuki's `hanafubuki-foundation`:
  `background_worker`, `blocking`, `cancellation`, `environment`,
  `json_normalization`, `module_faults`, `panic` (the host's hook takes a
  second containment check, the Agent's does not; the crash record's JSON is
  shared across the bridge: Hanafubuki's hook writes
  `data/agent/crash-record.json`, the Agent's start marker reads it),
  `paths`, `persistence`, `terminal_text`, `url_policy`, `user_agent`.
  Agent-only: `agent_settings`, `secrets`. Hanafubuki-only:
  `bounded_work_queue`, `concurrency`, `readiness`, `resolved`.
- `hanafubuki-agent-process` ↔ `hanafubuki-process`: `da_filter`,
  `executor`, `ownership`, `process_groups`, `terminal_size`,
  `test_support`, `tree`. Hanafubuki-only: `environment`.
- `hanafubuki-agent-host` ↔ `hanafubuki-module-contracts`: `error`,
  `fault`, `host` (without `RootServices::serve_bridge`), `logging`,
  `registry`, `restart`, `status`, `test_support`, `worker`.
  Hanafubuki-only: `bridge`.
- The integration goldens and history corpus (Hanafubuki's
  `hanafubuki-agent-integration/src/tests/golden/`) ↔ the facade's
  (`crates/agent/src/tests/golden/`): the history corpus is the same bytes in
  both; a history-format change re-records both.
